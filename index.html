                <p>I'm a musician, producer, designer, tinkerer, developer, artist and cryptoanarchist. I've worked with startups, governments, banks and crypto exchanges as an advisor, lived with a tribe in the Amazon, ran a surf hostel in Puerto Escondido, organized underground raves in Mexico City and been the creative director of a luxury kite-surfing boutique hotel in Adicora. I like disruptive projects and good music.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm co-running a workshop and artist collective in Venezuela, focused on the intersection of art & tech</p>
