                <h1 id="welcome">Welcome, this is mau writing.</h1><br>
                <p>I'm a full-stack web developer open for work. Also, a blockchain specialist, designer, and musician. I've worked with startups, governments, banks and crypto exchanges as an advisor, lived with a tribe in the Amazon, ran a surf hostel in Puerto Escondido and now I make electronic music events in Mexico City. I like disruptive projects and good music.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm diving deeper into online privacy, network security, ethical hacking and pentesting. As such, I've been teaching myself how to use Kali Linux and Tails. I'm also working in my first solo electronic music project which is heavily influenced by cyber culture.</p>
